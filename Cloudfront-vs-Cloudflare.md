# CloudFront vs Cloudflare Trade-offs

## What is Amazon CloudFront?

Amazon CloudFront is AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that:

- Caches content at 450+ edge locations worldwide
- Accelerates static and dynamic content delivery
- Integrates natively with AWS services (S3, EC2, Lambda@Edge)
- Provides built-in DDoS protection via AWS Shield
- Supports WebSocket for real-time applications
- Offers Origin Access Control for secure S3 integration

## How it works

- Users request content (video, API, or WebSocket).
- DNS sends them to the nearest CloudFront edge location (e.g., São Paulo).
- If cached → served instantly. If not, CloudFront fetches from the origin (S3, API, etc.), caches it, then serves.
- Regional caches + AWS backbone reduce origin load and speed things up.
- Security layers (Shield, WAF, SSL, signed URLs) protect content.
- Performance features (HTTP/2/3, compression, smart routing) make delivery fast.
- Updates: either invalidate cache or use versioned file names.
- Multi-tenant setup: each tenant can have its own path/bucket.

## Trade-offs Comparison

### PROS (+)

**CloudFront Advantages over Cloudflare:**

- **Zero AWS Egress Fees**: No data transfer costs from AWS services to CloudFront, saving ~$270/month per 100GB daily transfer compared to Cloudflare's $0.09/GB egress charges.

- **Native AWS Integration**: Direct IAM, Cognito, and S3 integration without API keys or separate authentication layers, unlike Cloudflare's complex AWS integration requiring custom scripts.

- **Unified Observability**: Single CloudWatch dashboard for all metrics versus Cloudflare's split between Cloudflare Analytics and AWS monitoring.

- **Brazilian Compliance**: São Paulo edge location with AWS Brazil entity simplifies tax compliance, while Cloudflare requires Enterprise plan for regional data controls.

### CONS (-)

- **Slower Invalidations**: 10-15 minutes to purge cache globally compared to Cloudflare's instant purge.

- **Less Configuration Flexibility**: No equivalent to Cloudflare's Page Rules for complex caching logic.

- **Superior Free Tier**: Cloudflare includes WAF, DDoS protection, and SSL at no cost, while CloudFront's WAF costs extra ($5/month + usage).

- **Predictable Pricing**: Flat-rate unlimited bandwidth on paid plans versus CloudFront's complex regional pricing.

- **Split Authentication**: Cannot directly use AWS Cognito tokens, requiring additional proxy layers.

- **High AWS Egress Costs**: Adds $2,700+/month for 100GB daily video transfer due to AWS egress fees.

- **Complex Integration**: Requires separate Terraform providers, API key management, and custom synchronization scripts.

## Recommendation

**CloudFront is the better choice**

The $30,000+ annual savings in egress fees alone justifies CloudFront for Mr. Bill's video-intensive POC platform. Combined with simplified multi-tenant architecture through native AWS integration, unified monitoring, and Brazilian market optimization, CloudFront provides superior TCO despite Cloudflare's technical advantages in edge computing and cache invalidation.
