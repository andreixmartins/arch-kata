# CloudFront vs Cloudflare Trade-offs

## What is Amazon CloudFront?

Amazon CloudFront is AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that:

- Caches content at 450+ edge locations worldwide
- Accelerates static and dynamic content delivery
- Integrates natively with AWS services (S3, EC2, Lambda@Edge)
- Provides built-in DDoS protection via AWS Shield
- Supports WebSocket for real-time applications
- Offers Origin Access Control for secure S3 integration

## How it works

- Users request content (video, API, or WebSocket).
- DNS sends them to the nearest CloudFront edge location (e.g., São Paulo).
- If cached → served instantly. If not, CloudFront fetches from the origin (S3, API, etc.), caches it, then serves.
- Regional caches + AWS backbone reduce origin load and speed things up.
- Security layers (Shield, WAF, SSL, signed URLs) protect content.
- Performance features (HTTP/2/3, compression, smart routing) make delivery fast.
- Updates: either invalidate cache or use versioned file names.
- Multi-tenant setup: each tenant can have its own path/bucket.

## Trade-offs Comparison

### 1. CloudFront

**PROS (+)**
- **Cost**: Zero AWS egress fees (saves ~$270/month per 100GB daily transfer, $30,000+ annually for video-intensive workloads)
- **Setup and Maintenance**: Native AWS integration with direct IAM, Cognito, and S3 integration; no API keys or separate authentication layers needed
- **Performance**: HTTP/2/3 support and smart routing; regional caches + AWS backbone optimization
- **Scalability**: 450+ edge locations worldwide with regional caches
- **Availability**: Built-in DDoS protection via AWS Shield; São Paulo edge location with AWS Brazil entity for compliance
- **Observability**: Unified CloudWatch dashboard for all metrics

**CONS (-)**
- **Performance**: Slower cache invalidations (10-15 minutes to purge cache globally)
- **Complexity**: Less configuration flexibility; no equivalent to Cloudflare's Page Rules for complex caching logic

### 2. Cloudflare

**PROS (+)**
- **Cost**: Superior free tier includes WAF, DDoS protection, and SSL at no cost; predictable flat-rate unlimited bandwidth on paid plans
- **Performance**: Instant cache purge; superior edge computing capabilities
- **Scalability**: Global network with advanced edge computing

**CONS (-)**
- **Cost**: High AWS egress costs ($2,700+/month for 100GB daily video transfer); CloudFront WAF costs extra ($5/month + usage)
- **Setup and Maintenance**: Complex AWS integration requiring separate Terraform providers, API key management overhead, custom synchronization scripts required
- **Complexity**: Requires additional proxy layers for AWS Cognito token integration
- **Availability**: Requires Enterprise plan for regional data controls
- **Observability**: Split monitoring between Cloudflare Analytics and AWS monitoring

## Recommendation

**CloudFront is the better choice**

The $30,000+ annual savings in egress fees alone justifies CloudFront for Mr. Bill's video-intensive POC platform. Combined with simplified multi-tenant architecture through native AWS integration, unified monitoring, and Brazilian market optimization, CloudFront provides superior TCO despite Cloudflare's technical advantages in edge computing and cache invalidation.
