### 1. üéØ Problem Statement and Context

What is the problem? What is the context of the problem?
Example:
```
MR Bill, wants a system to keep track of his favorite pocs, so you need to build a mobile app where mr Bill can register all his pocs, and also  
he needs to be able to search pocs, by name, by language,m by tags.
This system should be multi-tenant because mr bill will sell such system to.
Bunch of people in brazil, such system must have also ability to generate repots and generate a video with the all pocs
the users did in 1 year. Such system must be secure and have proper login and be able to support Realtime dojos using mr bill platform you will build for him.

### üß≠ 5. Trade-offs

List the tradeoffs analysis, comparing pros and cons for each major decision.
Before you need list all your major decisions, them run tradeoffs on than.
example:
Major Decisions: 
```
1. One mobile code base - should be (...)
2. Reusable capability and low latency backends should be (...)
3. Cache efficiency therefore should do (...)
4. Prioritize extreme performance (~1ms latency) for all database operations.
5. Choose a fully managed service to ensure high availability and minimize operational overhead.
```
Tradeoffs:
```
1. React Native vs (Flutter and Native)
2. Serverless vs Microservices
3. Redis vs Enbeded Caches
```
Each tradeoff line need to be:
```
PROS (+) 
  * Benefit: Explanation that justify why the benefit is true.
CONS (+)
  * Problem: Explanation that justify why the problem is true.


1. AWS Aurora PostgreSQL vs. AWS RDS for PostgreSQL
PROS (+)
  * Benefit: Superior Performance Architecture. Aurora's cloud-native, decoupled storage layer is specifically engineered for high throughput and low-latency I/O, making the consistent ~1ms performance target achievable. While RDS relies on network-attached EBS storage, which introduces inherent latency. Even the fastest io2 EBS volumes typically have latencies in the low milliseconds, making it extremely difficult to consistently stay under the 1ms threshold, especially for write operations and uncached reads under load.
CONS (-)
  * Problem: Higher Financial Cost. Aurora has a more complex and expensive pricing model based on instance size, storage consumption, and I/O operations, leading to a higher monthly bill compared to standard RDS.

2. AWS Aurora PostgreSQL vs. Self-Managed PostgreSQL on EC2
PROS (+)
  * Benefit: Reduced Operational Complexity. As a fully managed service, Aurora automates provisioning, patching, backups, and, most critically, high-availability failover, freeing developers from database administration tasks.
CONS (-)
  * Problem: Less Granular Control. Choosing Aurora means accepting AWS's managed path, which involves less direct control over underlying OS and database engine tuning compared to a self-managed instance on EC2.

3. AWS Aurora PostgreSQL vs. Apache Cassandra
PROS (+)
  * Benefit: Fully Managed by AWS. AWS handles all underlying infrastructure, including provisioning, patching, backups, failure detection, and failover. The management interface is integrated into the AWS console, CLI, and APIs, providing a seamless experience with other AWS services. This drastically reduces the operational burden on your team.
CONS (-)
  * Problem: Managed Service Constraints. You trade control for convenience. You have limited access to the underlying OS and cannot fine-tune every low-level database or system parameter. You are also dependent on AWS's timeline for support of new database versions and features.

- **Code Reusability**: Offers high-level APIs and pre-built infrastructure, which promotes reuse across different platforms and products.
- **Scalability**: Designed with cloud-native scaling in mind; Kubernetes-ready with multi-node support and autoscaling.
- **Setup and Maintenance**: Easy to deploy with prebuilt Docker images and Helm charts. Managed cloud option available (LiveKit Cloud).
- **Latency**: Low-latency architecture optimized for real-time use cases such as video conferencing, gaming, and virtual collaboration.
- **Monitoring / Observability**: Offers built-in Prometheus metrics, structured logs, and integration with Grafana dashboards.
- **Performance**: Includes optimizations like bandwidth adaptation, packet loss recovery, and adaptive streaming (simulcast, SVC).
- **Availability**: LiveKit Cloud offers high availability out of the box with managed infrastructure and SLAs.

**CONS (-)**

- **Complexity**: Abstracted logic limits low-level control. Custom media routing or deep protocol tweaks are not straightforward.
- **Cost**: LiveKit Cloud can become expensive at scale compared to self-hosted SFUs like MediaSoup.
- **Disk Usage Overhead**: Recording or archiving requires external services (like LiveKit Recorder) and adds complexity/cost.
- **Limitations**: Geared mainly toward standard RTC workflows. Less flexible for exotic use cases or novel media topologies.

**MediaSoup**

**PROS (+)**

- **Complexity / Flexibility**: Offers full control over RTP, SCTP, DTLS, and media pipeline. Ideal for custom or unconventional WebRTC architectures.
- **Cost**: Fully open-source and self-hosted; no vendor lock-in or usage-based fees.
- **Latency**: Minimal internal processing makes it highly performant with ultra-low-latency potential.
- **Performance**: Efficient, lightweight, and highly tunable. Fine-grained control over bandwidth, layers, and routing.
- **Disk Usage Overhead**: No forced dependency on recorders or file storage ‚Äî you implement what you need.
- **Code Reusability**: Node.js and C++ APIs allow tight integration into custom server architectures.
- **Observability**: Raw metrics and debugging access to RTP internals allow fine performance analysis.

**CONS (-)**

- **Setup and Maintenance**: Requires significant effort to build signaling, room logic, and orchestration from scratch. No built-in user or track management.
- **Scalability**: No built-in horizontal scaling or cluster awareness ‚Äî scaling needs manual implementation (e.g., via load balancers or custom SFU routers).
- **Monitoring**: Lacks integrated dashboards or metrics. Requires custom Prometheus exporters or external tooling.
- **Compatibility**: Fewer official SDKs and integrations; community-led efforts vary in quality and completeness.
- **Availability**: You must build your own HA/Failover setup ‚Äî especially challenging in multi-region environments.
- **Limitations**: Steep learning curve; requires strong understanding of WebRTC internals and RTP networking.

### Final Recommendation: Use LiveKit

Why?

```
- You get battle-tested signaling, media routing, SDKs, scaling, and observability out-of-the-box.

- Perfect fit for low-latency 1:1 and small group live coding sessions.

- Lower ops burden for a small or mid-size engineering team.

- You can ship a working MVP in weeks, not months.
```

### Persistence Model

### **Diagrams / Table Structures**

```plaintext
Table: rooms
- id (PK)
- name
- created_at
- is_active

Table: participants
- id (PK)
- room_id (FK -> rooms.id)
- identity
- role
- joined_at
- is_connected

Table: tracks
- id (PK)
- participant_id (FK -> participants.id)
- kind
- codec
- created_at
```

### **Partitioning Strategy**

- **Rooms**: Could be partitioned by `region` or `tenant_id` if multi-tenant.
- **Participants**: Partition by `room_id` for faster lookup.
- **Tracks**: Co-located with participants for better locality.

### **Main Queries**

1. Fetch all participants in a room:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM participants WHERE room_id = :room_id;
   ```

2. Get active rooms:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM rooms WHERE is_active = true;
   ```

3. Get tracks by participant:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE participant_id = :participant_id;
   ```

---

### Algorithms / Data Structures

### **Data Structures**

- `Map<String, Room>` for room lookup
- `Set<Participant>` in a Room for O(1) joins/leaves
- `Map<String, Track>` in Participant for quick access
- `MessageQueue` (Pub/Sub) for signaling layer (if custom signaling is used)

### **Algorithms**

- **Auto-room cleanup**:
  When the last participant leaves, schedule a timeout job to close the room (debounced).

- **Adaptive bitrate selection**:
  Based on packet loss / RTT metrics ‚Äî adjust simulcast layer dynamically

- **Track Routing Algorithm** (in SFU layer):

  - Inputs: subscriber bandwidth, CPU load
  - Output: optimal video quality layer
  - Could use a simple scoring model per subscriber:

    ```python
    score = available_bandwidth / number_of_tracks
    ```

- **Participant Sorting**:
  Sort active speakers by loudness score or priority for layout/rendering:

  ```python
  sorted(participants, key=lambda p: p.audio_level, reverse=True)
  ```
