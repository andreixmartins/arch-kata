## üèõÔ∏è Structure

### 1. üéØ Problem Statement and Context

What is the problem? What is the context of the problem?
Example:
```
MR Bill, wants a system to keep track of his favorite pocs, so you need to build a mobile app where mr Bill can register all his pocs, and also  
he needs to be able to search pocs, by name, by language,m by tags.
This system should be multi-tenant because mr bill will sell such system to.
Bunch of people in brazil, such system must have also ability to generate repots and generate a video with the all pocs
the users did in 1 year. Such system must be secure and have proper login and be able to support Realtime dojos using mr bill platform you will build for him.

1. Track favorites POCs
2. Mobile app to register POC
3. Searching POCs by name, language and tags
4. Multi-tentant system
5. Generate reports
6. Generate POC videos
7. System must be secure

### 2. üéØ Goals

List in form of bullets what goals do have. Here it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Solution needs to be fast! Performance for all operations bellow ~1 ms.
2. Security is non-negociable! Security at-rest, transite, threat analysis and review for by at least 3 different people.

### 3. üéØ Non-Goals

List in form of bullets what non-goals do have. Here it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Be perfect: There will be mistakes, we dont want have automatic-rollback for everything.

### üìê 3. Principles

List in form of bullets what design principles you want to be followed, it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Low Coupling: We need to watch for coupling all times.
2. Flexibility: Users should be able to customize behavior without leaking the internals of the system. Leverage interfaces.
3. Observability: we should expose all key metrics on main features. Sucess and errors counters need to be exposed.
4. Testability: Chaos engineering is a must and property testing. Testing should be done by engineers all times.
5. Cache efficiency: Should leverage SSD caches and all forms of caches as much as possible.
6. Testability: We must apply unit-test, regression-tests, chaos tests
7. Scalability: Handle amounts of work, data, or users without performance degradation
8. Availability: Ensure a high level of uptime 99.9%
```

### üèóÔ∏è 4. Overall Diagrams

Here there will be a bunch of diagrams, to understand the solution.
```
üóÇÔ∏è 4.1 Overall architecture: Show the big picture, relationship between macro components.
üóÇÔ∏è 4.2 Deployment: Show the infra in a big picture. 
üóÇÔ∏è 4.3 Use Cases: Make 1 macro use case diagram that list the main capability that needs to be covered. 
```

### üß≠ 5. Trade-offs

List the tradeoffs analysis, comparing pros and cons for each major decision.
Before you need list all your major decisions, them run tradeoffs on than.
example:
Major Decisions: 
```
1. One mobile code base - should be (...)
2. Reusable capability and low latency backends should be (...)
3. Cache efficiency therefore should do (...)
4. Prioritize extreme performance (~1ms latency) for all database operations.
5. Choose a fully managed service to ensure high availability and minimize operational overhead.
```
Tradeoffs:
```
1. React Native vs (Flutter and Native)
2. Serverless vs Microservices
3. Redis vs Enbeded Caches
```
Each tradeoff line need to be:
```
PROS (+) 
  * Benefit: Explanation that justify why the benefit is true.
CONS (+)
  * Problem: Explanation that justify why the problem is true.

Amazon Keyspaces
PROS (+)
  * Benefit: Multi-Tenant Isolation - Native partition-based isolation ensures complete tenant data separation without complex application logic.
  * Benefit: Auto-Scaling - Seamlessly handles variable workloads across tenants without manual intervention or capacity planning.
