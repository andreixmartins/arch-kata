## Application Load Balancer (ALB)

### Use Cases
- HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Web applications, REST APIs
- Microservices or containerized applications (ECS, EKS)
- Host-based or path-based routing
- Authentication via Cognito or OIDC
- WebSocket and HTTP/2 support

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer)
- Intelligent request routing (host/path headers)
- Integrated with AWS WAF 
- Supports advanced routing (redirects, fixed responses)
- Native support for HTTP/2 and WebSockets

### ‚ùå Cons
- Only supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- Slightly higher latency than NLB
- No static IP support


## Network Load Balancer (NLB)

### Use Cases
- TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic
- Real-time applications (VoIP, gaming, financial apps)
- Applications requiring very low latency and high throughput
- Need for static IP or Elastic IP addresses
- Preserving the client IP address

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
- Extremely high performance and low latency
- Handles millions of requests per second
- Static IP and Elastic IP support
- TLS termination and pass-through support

### ‚ùå Cons
- No application-layer routing (no path/host-based routing)
- Limited visibility into HTTP-layer traffic
- No direct integration with AWS WAF or Cognito

## Load Balancing Algorithms Used in AWS

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- **Round Robin (Default)**  
  Requests are distributed sequentially across targets in a target group.  
  Good for evenly sized workloads.

- **Least Outstanding Requests**  
  Requests are routed to the target with the fewest active (in-flight) requests.  
  Better for variable latency workloads.

### Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- **Flow Hash Algorithm (Default)**  
  Uses a 5-tuple hash (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol) to consistently route traffic to the same target.  
  Preserves session affinity (*sticky sessions*) by default.

- **Source IP Affinity (Optional)**  
  Allows you to enable stickiness based on the source IP address.  
  Useful when consistent backend assignment is needed as session-based apps.
