## üèõÔ∏è Structure

### 1. üéØ Problem Statement and Context

What is the problem? What is the context of the problem?
Example:
```
MR Bill, wants a system to keep track of his favorite pocs, so you need to build a mobile app where mr Bill can register all his pocs, and also  
he needs to be able to search pocs, by name, by language,m by tags.
This system should be multi-tenant because mr bill will sell such system to.
Bunch of people in brazil, such system must have also ability to generate repots and generate a video with the all pocs
the users did in 1 year. Such system must be secure and have proper login and be able to support Realtime dojos using mr bill platform you will build for him.

1. Track favorites POCs
2. Mobile native app to register POC
3. Searching POCs by name, language and tags
4. Multi-tentant system
5. Generate reports
6. Generate videos
7. System must be secure
8. Users will have their credentials

### 2. üéØ Goals

List in form of bullets what goals do have. Here it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Security is non-negociable! Security at-rest, transite, threat analysis and review for by at least 3 different people.
2. Mobile-native: We want a native app using Swift and Kotlin 
3. Cloud-Native: All backend must be 100% cloud native, using AWS Cloud services
4. Microservices: Do not use AWS Lambdas. App services must use the microservice architecture
5. Cache: AWS Elastic Cache to cache user data information
6. Tests: Employ unit tests, integration tests, regression tests, chaos tests
```

### 3. üéØ Non-Goals

List in form of bullets what non-goals do have. Here it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Be perfect: There will be mistakes, we dont want have automatic-rollback for everything.
2. DynamoDB: Dynamo is expensive, we want be away from the DB.
3. AWS Lambdas: We do not want to use it.
4. Monoliths: We must not use monolith architecture
5. Single Relational Database: We must use relational database distributed in different AZ
6. Other Cloud Services: We must only use AWS Services
```

### üìê 3. Principles

List in form of bullets what design principles you want to be followed, it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Low Coupling: We need to watch for coupling all times.
2. Flexibility: Users should be able to customize behavior without leaking the internals of the system. Leverage interfaces.
3. Observability: we should expose all key metrics on main features. Sucess and errors counters need to be exposed.
4. Testability: Chaos engineering is a must and property testing. Testing should be done by engineers all times.
5. Cache efficiency: Should leverage SSD caches and all forms of caches as much as possible.
6. Testability: We must apply unit-test, regression-tests, chaos tests
7. Scalability: Handle amounts of work, data, or users without performance degradation
8. Availability: Ensure a high level of uptime 99.9%
```

### üß≠ 5. Trade-offs

List the tradeoffs analysis, comparing pros and cons for each major decision.
Before you need list all your major decisions, them run tradeoffs on than.
example:
Major Decisions: 
```
1. Two mobile code base - Mobile application should be developed in Swift to handle IOS and Kotlin for Android versions.
2. Backend application should be built using microservices separated by schema/domains instead of serveless approach.
3. Cache - Use AWS Elastic cache instead of Redis
```
Tradeoffs:
```
1. AWS Cognito vs Keycloak
2. AWS ECS vs AWS EKS
3. AWS KEYSPACES vs AWS RDS POSTGRES
4. Redis (Self-Hosted) vs AWS Elastic Cache
```


## AWS Cognito vs Keycloak

AWS Cognito
```
PROS (+) 
  * Setup and Maintenance: Easy to set up with managed service, minimal infra overhead.
  * Cost: Pricing based on MAUs (monthly active users), no server costs.
  * Integration: Tight integration with AWS (IAM, API Gateway, Lambda).
CONS (+)
  * Scalability: Bound to AWS regions and infra.
  * Customization: Branding and flow changes limited to AWS features.
  * Vendor Lock-in: Difficult to migrate away from AWS infra.
```

Keycloak
```
PROS (+) 
  * Setup and Maintenance: Full control over installation, configuration, and setup.
  * Scalability: Can scale with Kubernetes/infra as needed.
  * Cost: Open-source, no license fees.
  * Customization: Fully customizable login, flows, and theming.
  * Integration: Works well across cloud and on-prem systems (OIDC, SAML, LDAP).
CONS (+)
  * Limitations: Full burden of upgrades and migration lies on you.
  * Security: Security depends on in-house team vigilance.
```

## AWS ECS vs AWS EKS

AWS EKS on Fargate
```
PROS (+) 
  * Zero node management: AWS abstracts away VMs.
  * Strong workload isolation: Each Pod runs in a micro-VM-like sandbox. Great for multi-tenancy.
  * Predictable billing: Pay per vCPU and GiB-hour. No overprovisioning nodes.
  * Scaling: Near-instant for moderate workloads (subject to Fargate launch quotas).

CONS (+)
  * Feature limitations: No DaemonSets, no privileged/host networking, no GPUs, limited ephemeral disk (~20 GiB).
  * Observability overhead: Agents must be sidecars (instead of cluster-wide DaemonSets).
  * Cost at scale: Can be more expensive than EC2 if you have high sustained workloads.
  * Startup throttles: Large Pod bursts can hit account Fargate launch quotas.
```

ECS on Fargate
```
PROS (+) 
  * Zero infrastructure management: AWS handles provisioning, scaling, patching.
  * Isolation: Strong security boundary per task (ideal for multi-tenancy).
  * Pay-as-you-go: Billing is per vCPU and GiB-hour, no wasted capacity.
  * Auto-scaling: Tasks scale without cluster capacity planning.

CONS (+)
  * Feature limits: No privileged containers, host networking, GPUs.
  * Cost: More expensive for sustained or heavy workloads than EC2.
  * Quotas: Fargate launch throttles and ephemeral storage (~20 GiB default).
  * Observability: No DaemonSets ‚Äî logging/monitoring agents must run as sidecars (extra cost overhead).
```

## AWS KEYSPACES vs AWS RDS POSTGRES

AWS KEYSPACES
```
PROS (+) 
  * Scalability: Horizontal scaling, Elastic on-demand throughput.
  * Avaiability: Built-in AWS multi-Region
  * Performance: Millisecond latencies with predictable performance when partitions are modeled well.
  * Replication: Built-in multi-Region, active-active (async replication).
  * Operation: Fully managed, serverless-like. No clusters/patching. Pay-per-request.
  
CONS (+)
  * Consistency: Tunable consistency, but no global ACID transactions.
  * Analytics: Not suitable for BI/reporting without ETL into another system.
  * Cost: Per-request pricing can get expensive if query patterns are inefficient.
```

AWS RDS PostgreSQL
```
PROS (+) 
  * Scalability: Scales vertically and horizontally via Aurora read replicas.
  * Perfomance: Strong OLTP performance with indexes and joins.
  * Latency: Low-latency reads in multiple Regions
  
CONS (+)
  * Limitation: Must use RDS Proxy or pooling for apps with millions of users.
  * Operation: Still need to think about version upgrades, storage, scaling thresholds, and failover planning.
  * Multi-Region writes: Global database only supports fast cross-Region reads; writes go to one Region.
```


## AWS MSK (KAFKA) vs AWS SQS

AWS MSK (KAFKA)
```
PROS (+) 
  * Debugging: Event streaming with replay/rewind
  * Scalability: High throughput
  * Consistency: Strict ordering per partition
  * Integration: Rich ecosystem (Kafka Streams, Flink, Connect)
CONS (+)
  * Overhead: Operational complexity
  * Cost: Costly at low/variable volume
```

AWS SQS
```
PROS (+) 
  * Simplicity: Fully managed, zero ops
  * Cost: Pay-per-request pricing
  * Reliability: DLQs and retries built-in
  * Security: IAM integration + per-queue isolation
  * Automation: Tight AWS integration (Lambda, Step Functions)
CONS (+)
  * Duplication: At-least-once delivery only
```


## Redis (Self-Hosted) vs AWS Elastic Cache

Redis
```
PROS (+) 
  * Performance: Redis offers multiple methods for caching data, which can significantly reduce data access latency and increase throughput.
CONS (+)
  * Cost: Redis clustering solutions needs to be done in-house and requires a significant amount of effort.
```

AWS Elastic Cache
```
PROS (+) 
  * Setup and Maintenance: ElastiCache is a fully managed AWS service for Redis, not necessary to deal with ec2 instances and configs to install Redis.
CONS (+)
  * Limitations: ElastiCache runs only within the Amazon Web Services ecosystem, you may be concerned about vendor lock-in
```

Note: Cassandra database does not have a column size property. We must limit the number of characters on the application side.



#### 6.4 - Algorithms/Data Structures : Specific algos that need to be used, along size with spesific data structures.

- Queue for creating/deleting messages
- Queue for message notifications


Samples of other components: Batch jobs, Events, 3rd Party Integrations, Streaming, ML Models, ChatBots, etc...

### üñπ 7. Migrations

IF Migrations are required describe the migrations strategy with proper diagrams, text and tradeoffs.

- N/A

### üñπ 8. Testing strategy

Explain the techniques, principles, types of tests and will be performaned, and spesific details how to mock data, stress test it, spesific chaos goals and assumptions.

- Manual testing -  Involves manual inspection and testing of the software by a human tester.
- Automated testing - software tools to automate the testing process
- Unit testing - Tests individual units or components of the software to ensure they are functioning as intended.
- Integration testing - Tests the integration of different components of the software to ensure they work together as a system.
- Regression testing ‚Äì Tests the software after changes or modifications have been made to ensure the changes have not introduced new defects.
- Performance testing - Tests the software to determine its performance characteristics such as speed, scalability, and stability.
- Security testing ‚Äì Tests the software to identify vulnerabilities and ensure it meets security requirements.
- Usability testing ‚Äì Tests the software to evaluate its user-friendliness and ease of use.

### üñπ 9. Observability strategy

Explain the techniques, principles,types of observability that will be used, key metrics, what would be logged and how to design proper dashboards and alerts.

- Dojo system will generated service metrics , the metrics will be consumed by Prometheus,Grafana and Loki stack 
- Grafana will provide customized dashboards to identify errors , alerts and also providing ways to troubleshoot 
- Metrics dashboards should contain errors,alert identifying any service errors

### üñπ 10. Data Store Designs

For each different kind of data store i.e (Postgres, Memcached, Elasticache, S3, Neo4J etc...) describe the schemas, what would be stored there and why, main queries, expectations on performance. Diagrams are welcome but you really need some dictionaries.

- AWS S3 for videos, images, text files, reports
- AWS RDS Postgres for structured data
- AWS Elastic cache for caching data
- AWS Keyspaces (Apache Cassandra)

### **AWS Keyspaces (Cassandra) Queries**

- Find user
```sql
SELECT id, username, firstname, lastname, email, age, created, updated FROM app.user where id = ?;  
```

- Find room users
```sql
SELECT id, username, userstatus, roomid, roomname, roomstatus, created, updated FROM app.roomUser where userid = ?;   
```

- Find room messages
```sql
SELECT id, userid, username, roomid, roomname, messagecontent, messagetype, created, updated FROM app.roomUserMessage where roomid = ?;     
```

- Find user room messages by room
```sql
SELECT id, userid, username, roomid, roomname, messagecontent, messagetype, created, updated FROM app.roomUserMessage where roomid = ?;     
```

- Find user room messages by roomtid, userid and created date
```sql
select currentDate(), dateof(now()), id, userid, username, roomname, content, read, type, created from app.message where roomid = ? AND userid = ? AND created >= ? - 1d;
```

### üñπ 11. Technology Stack

Describe your stack, what databases would be used, what servers, what kind of components, mobile/ui approach, general architecture components, frameworks and libs to be used or not be used and why.

- Android UI: Kotlin
- IOS UI: Swift
- Language: Java 23
- Framework:	Spring Boot 3
- Container: Docker
- Orchestration:	EKS Kubernetes
- API: REST
- Auth: OAuth2 + JWT
- Databases: AWS Keyspaces (Cassandra) PostgreSQL + Redis
- Messaging: Kafka (AWS MSK)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Logging: Loki
- Tracing: Xray
- Realtime video - NodeJS + WebRTC
