### 1. üéØ Problem Statement and Context

What is the problem? What is the context of the problem?
Example:
```
MR Bill, wants a system to keep track of his favorite pocs, so you need to build a mobile app where mr Bill can register all his pocs, and also  
he needs to be able to search pocs, by name, by language,m by tags.
This system should be multi-tenant because mr bill will sell such system to.
Bunch of people in brazil, such system must have also ability to generate repots and generate a video with the all pocs
the users did in 1 year. Such system must be secure and have proper login and be able to support Realtime dojos using mr bill platform you will build for him.

1. Track favorites POCs
2. Mobile app to register POC
3. Searching POCs by name, language and tags
4. Multi-tentant system
5. Generate reports
6. Generate POC videos
7. System must be secure
8. Users will have their credentials

4. Testability: Chaos engineering is a must and property testing. Testing should be done by engineers all times.
5. Cache efficiency: Should leverage SSD caches and all forms of caches as much as possible.
6. Testability: We must apply unit-test, regression-tests, chaos tests
7. Scalability: Handle amounts of work, data, or users without performance degradation
8. Availability: Ensure a high level of uptime 99.9%

List the tradeoffs analysis, comparing pros and cons for each major decision.
Before you need list all your major decisions, them run tradeoffs on than.
example:
Major Decisions:

1. One mobile code base - should be (...)
2. Reusable capability and low latency backends should be (...)
3. Cache efficiency therefore should do (...)
4. Prioritize extreme performance (~1ms latency) for all database operations.
5. Choose a fully managed service to ensure high availability and minimize operational overhead.
```
Tradeoffs:
```
1. React Native vs (Flutter and Native)
2. Serverless vs Microservices
3. Redis vs Enbeded Caches
```
Each tradeoff line need to be:

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)

### Use Cases
- HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Web applications, REST APIs
- Microservices or containerized applications (ECS, EKS)
- Host-based or path-based routing
- Authentication via Cognito or OIDC
- WebSocket and HTTP/2 support

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer)
- Intelligent request routing (host/path headers)
- Integrated with AWS WAF 
- Supports advanced routing (redirects, fixed responses)
- Native support for HTTP/2 and WebSockets

### ‚ùå Cons
- Only supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- Slightly higher latency than NLB
- No static IP support


## Network Load Balancer (NLB)

### Use Cases
- TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic
- Real-time applications (VoIP, gaming, financial apps)
- Applications requiring very low latency and high throughput
- Need for static IP or Elastic IP addresses
- Preserving the client IP address

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
- Extremely high performance and low latency
- Handles millions of requests per second
- Static IP and Elastic IP support
- TLS termination and pass-through support

### ‚ùå Cons
- No application-layer routing (no path/host-based routing)
- Limited visibility into HTTP-layer traffic
- No direct integration with AWS WAF or Cognito

## Load Balancing Algorithms Used in AWS

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- **Round Robin (Default)**  
  Requests are distributed sequentially across targets in a target group.  
  Good for evenly sized workloads.

- **Least Outstanding Requests**  
  Requests are routed to the target with the fewest active (in-flight) requests.  
  Better for variable latency workloads.

### Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- **Flow Hash Algorithm (Default)**  
  Uses a 5-tuple hash (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol) to consistently route traffic to the same target.  
  Preserves session affinity (*sticky sessions*) by default.

- **Source IP Affinity (Optional)**  
  Allows you to enable stickiness based on the source IP address.  
  Useful when consistent backend assignment is needed as session-based apps.


PS: Be careful to not confuse problem with explanation.
