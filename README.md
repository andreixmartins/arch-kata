## üèõÔ∏è Structure

### 1. üéØ Problem Statement and Context

What is the problem? What is the context of the problem?
Example:
```
MR Bill, wants a system to keep track of his favorite pocs, so you need to build a mobile app where mr Bill can register all his pocs, and also  
he needs to be able to search pocs, by name, by language,m by tags.
This system should be multi-tenant because mr bill will sell such system to.
Bunch of people in brazil, such system must have also ability to generate repots and generate a video with the all pocs
the users did in 1 year. Such system must be secure and have proper login and be able to support Realtime dojos using mr bill platform you will build for him.

1. Track favorites POCs
2. Mobile app to register POC
3. Searching POCs by name, language and tags
4. Multi-tentant system
5. Generate reports
6. Generate POC videos
7. System must be secure
8. Users will have their credentials

### 2. üéØ Goals

List in form of bullets what goals do have. Here it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Solution needs to be fast! Performance for all operations bellow ~1 ms.
2. Security is non-negociable! Security at-rest, transite, threat analysis and review for by at least 3 different people.
3. Mobile-native: We want a native app using Swift and Kotlin 
4. Cloud-Native: All backend must be 100% cloud native, using AWS Cloud services
5. Microservices: Do not use AWS Lambdas
6. Cache: AWS Elastic Cache to cache user data information
7. Tests: Employ unit tests, integration tests, regression tests, chaos tests
8. Microservices: App services must use the microservice architecture
9. Amazon OpenSearch: Realtime application monitoring and security Analytics
10. Amazon RDS: Postgres for relational data

### 3. üéØ Non-Goals

List in form of bullets what non-goals do have. Here it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Be perfect: There will be mistakes, we dont want have automatic-rollback for everything.
2. DynamoDB: Dynamo is expensive, we want be away from the DB.
3. AWS Lambdas: We do not want to use it.
4. Monoliths: We must not use monolith architecture
5. Single Relational Database: We must use relational database distributed in different AZ
6. Other Cloud Services: We must only use AWS Services

### üìê 3. Principles

List in form of bullets what design principles you want to be followed, it's great to have 5-10 lines.
Example:
```
1. Low Coupling: We need to watch for coupling all times.
2. Flexibility: Users should be able to customize behavior without leaking the internals of the system. Leverage interfaces.
3. Observability: we should expose all key metrics on main features. Sucess and errors counters need to be exposed.
4. Testability: Chaos engineering is a must and property testing. Testing should be done by engineers all times.
5. Cache efficiency: Should leverage SSD caches and all forms of caches as much as possible.
6. Testability: We must apply unit-test, regression-tests, chaos tests
7. Scalability: Handle amounts of work, data, or users without performance degradation
8. Availability: Ensure a high level of uptime 99.9%
```

### üèóÔ∏è 4. Overall Diagrams

Here there will be a bunch of diagrams, to understand the solution.
```
üóÇÔ∏è 4.1 Overall architecture: Show the big picture, relationship between macro components.
üóÇÔ∏è 4.2 Deployment: Show the infra in a big picture. 
üóÇÔ∏è 4.3 Use Cases: Make 1 macro use case diagram that list the main capability that needs to be covered. 
```

### üß≠ 5. Trade-offs

List the tradeoffs analysis, comparing pros and cons for each major decision.
Before you need list all your major decisions, them run tradeoffs on than.
example:
Major Decisions: 
```
1. One mobile code base - should be (...)
2. Reusable capability and low latency backends should be (...)
3. Cache efficiency therefore should do (...)
4. Prioritize extreme performance (~1ms latency) for all database operations.
5. Choose a fully managed service to ensure high availability and minimize operational overhead.
```
Tradeoffs:
```
1. React Native vs (Flutter and Native)
2. Serverless vs Microservices
3. Redis vs Enbeded Caches
```
Each tradeoff line need to be:
```
PROS (+) 
  * Benefit: Explanation that justify why the benefit is true.
CONS (+)
  * Problem: Explanation that justify why the problem is true.


1. AWS Aurora PostgreSQL vs. AWS RDS for PostgreSQL
PROS (+)
  * Benefit: Superior Performance Architecture. Aurora's cloud-native, decoupled storage layer is specifically engineered for high throughput and low-latency I/O, making the consistent ~1ms performance target achievable. While RDS relies on network-attached EBS storage, which introduces inherent latency. Even the fastest io2 EBS volumes typically have latencies in the low milliseconds, making it extremely difficult to consistently stay under the 1ms threshold, especially for write operations and uncached reads under load.
CONS (-)
  * Problem: Higher Financial Cost. Aurora has a more complex and expensive pricing model based on instance size, storage consumption, and I/O operations, leading to a higher monthly bill compared to standard RDS.

2. AWS Aurora PostgreSQL vs. Self-Managed PostgreSQL on EC2
PROS (+)
  * Benefit: Reduced Operational Complexity. As a fully managed service, Aurora automates provisioning, patching, backups, and, most critically, high-availability failover, freeing developers from database administration tasks.
CONS (-)
  * Problem: Less Granular Control. Choosing Aurora means accepting AWS's managed path, which involves less direct control over underlying OS and database engine tuning compared to a self-managed instance on EC2.

3. AWS Aurora PostgreSQL vs. Apache Cassandra
PROS (+)
  * Benefit: Fully Managed by AWS. AWS handles all underlying infrastructure, including provisioning, patching, backups, failure detection, and failover. The management interface is integrated into the AWS console, CLI, and APIs, providing a seamless experience with other AWS services. This drastically reduces the operational burden on your team.
CONS (-)
  * Problem: Managed Service Constraints. You trade control for convenience. You have limited access to the underlying OS and cannot fine-tune every low-level database or system parameter. You are also dependent on AWS's timeline for support of new database versions and features.

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)

### Use Cases
- HTTP/HTTPS traffic
- Web applications, REST APIs
- Microservices or containerized applications (ECS, EKS)
- Host-based or path-based routing
- Authentication via Cognito or OIDC
- WebSocket and HTTP/2 support

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer)
- Intelligent request routing (host/path headers)
- Integrated with AWS WAF 
- Supports advanced routing (redirects, fixed responses)
- Native support for HTTP/2 and WebSockets

### ‚ùå Cons
- Only supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols
- Slightly higher latency than NLB
- No static IP support


## Network Load Balancer (NLB)

### Use Cases
- TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic
- Real-time applications (VoIP, gaming, financial apps)
- Applications requiring very low latency and high throughput
- Need for static IP or Elastic IP addresses
- Preserving the client IP address

### ‚úÖ Pros
- Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
- Extremely high performance and low latency
- Handles millions of requests per second
- Static IP and Elastic IP support
- TLS termination and pass-through support

### ‚ùå Cons
- No application-layer routing (no path/host-based routing)
- Limited visibility into HTTP-layer traffic
- No direct integration with AWS WAF or Cognito

## Load Balancing Algorithms Used in AWS

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- **Round Robin (Default)**  
  Requests are distributed sequentially across targets in a target group.  
  Good for evenly sized workloads.

- **Least Outstanding Requests**  
  Requests are routed to the target with the fewest active (in-flight) requests.  
  Better for variable latency workloads.

### Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- **Flow Hash Algorithm (Default)**  
  Uses a 5-tuple hash (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol) to consistently route traffic to the same target.  
  Preserves session affinity (*sticky sessions*) by default.

- **Source IP Affinity (Optional)**  
  Allows you to enable stickiness based on the source IP address.  
  Useful when consistent backend assignment is needed as session-based apps.


PS: Be careful to not confuse problem with explanation.
